To access your Docker Compose application on another machine without losing data, you need to follow these steps to migrate your application and its data:

### Step 1: Backup Your Data

1. **Stop Your Compose Application**: Ensure your application is stopped to prevent data changes during the backup.

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

2. **Backup Volumes**: Use the `docker run` command to create a backup of your volumes. For each volume, run a command like this:

   ```bash
   docker run --rm -v app:/data -v $(pwd):/backup busybox tar cvf /backup/app-data.tar /data
   ```

   Replace `app` with the name of each volume you need to back up. This command creates a tarball of the volume data in your current directory.

### Step 2: Export Your Compose Application

1. **Save Images**: Save the Docker images used by your Compose application to a tar file.

   ```bash
   docker save -o myapp-images.tar $(docker compose images -q)
   ```

2. **Copy Compose Files**: Ensure you have a copy of your `docker-compose.yml` and any other configuration files.

### Step 3: Transfer Files to the New Machine

1. **Transfer Backup Files**: Copy the tar files and your Compose files to the new machine. You can use tools like `scp`, `rsync`, or a USB drive.

### Step 4: Set Up the New Machine

1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on the new machine. Follow the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if needed.

2. **Load Docker Images**: Load the saved Docker images on the new machine.

   ```bash
   docker load -i myapp-images.tar
   ```

3. **Restore Volumes**: For each volume, create a new volume and restore the data.

   ```bash
   docker volume create app
   docker run --rm -v app:/data -v $(pwd):/backup busybox sh -c "cd /data && tar xvf /backup/app-data.tar --strip 1"
   ```

### Step 5: Start Your Compose Application

1. **Navigate to the Directory**: Go to the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` is located.

2. **Start the Application**: Use Docker Compose to start your application.

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Verify Functionality**: Check that your application is running correctly and that all data is accessible.

By following these steps, you can migrate your Docker Compose application to another machine without losing data. If you need more detailed information on any step, refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).
